# Bulls-and-Cows

## About The Project

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game 1A2B (also known as Bulls and Cows). In this game, players try to guess a secret four-digit number. After each guess, the game provides feedback in the form of "A" and "B" to indicate how close the guess is to the secret number.

## Key Features
- User can input a four-digit number with unique digits (0-9).
- The game provides feedback on each guess
- Players continue guessing until they correctly guess the secret number or choose to quit the game.
